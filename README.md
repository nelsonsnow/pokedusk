### Comprehensive List of Changes ###
- The Fairy-type has been added as a new Pokémon type.
    - This type features the type icon in the summary menu.
    - Moves and Pokémon that were changed to be Fairy-type in newer games have been updated.
- The "Physical/Special Split" has been implemented.
    - Each move is defined as either physical, special, or status.
    - Places where the game previously checked the type, it now checks the move.
    - Icons for move categories have been added to the status menu.
- All previously unnecessarily capitalized text has been decapitalized. (Thanks to [**lioniac**](https://github.com/lioniac/frdecap)!)
- The default text speed has been changed to fast.
